# # Solving the Maximal Independent Set Problem on defective King Graph
# ## Introduction
# In this tutorial we show how to use some of Bloqade's built-in tools to generate a
# defects in a graph and then use Bloqade to solve the Maximal Independent Set (MIS)
# problem on a Unit Disk Graph (UDG) which are easily expressable on Neutral Atom
# Hardware via the Rydberg blockade mechanism. We will not cover hybrid quantum-
# classical algorithms in this tutorial, but instead we will use a simple parameter
# scan to find optimal detuning value for an adiabatic ramp. We will cover hybrid
# quantum-classical algorithms in a future tutorials.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Define the program.
# To define random defects on any Bloqade geometry simply call the `add_defect_density`
# or `add_defect_count` methods on the geometry object. The `add_defect_density` method
# takes a float between 0 and 1 and use that as the probability of a site being a 
# defect. The `add_defect_count` method takes an integer and uses that as the number of 
# defects to add to the geometry placed in random locations. Both methods take an 
# optional `rng` argument which is a numpy random number generator. If no `rng` argument
# is provided, then the default numpy random number generator is used. Using the random
# number generator allows you to set the seed for reproducibility. After that defining
# the pulse sequence is the same as in the previous tutorials.

# we will run on hardware.

# ## Plot Results
# Here the total number of Rydberg excitations is plotted as a function of the final
# detuning. The total number of Rydberg excitations are a proxy for the the largest
# independent set size because the number of violations to the Rydberg blockade is
# will not scalr with the size of the independent set. We start by loading the results

# batch.fetch()
# save(filename, batch)

# %% [markdown]
# the report object already has a method to calculate the rydberg densities. We can
# ise this to calculate the average total rydberg density for each final detuning.
# then we can plot the results.
