# You can download the job files by clicking the "Download Job" button above. You'll then need to place

# # Quantum Scar Dynamics
# ## Introduction
# In this example we show how to use Bloqade to run a quantum scar dynamics experiment.
# The protocol is as follows: We first prepare the atoms in a Z2 state using an
# adiabatic sweep. We then apply a Rabi pulse to the atoms, which will cause the atoms
# to oscillate but because of the Blockade effect, the atoms will not be able to
# transition to the Rydberg state. However, the atoms will still oscillate between the
# ground and some other excited many-body states.


# %% [markdown]
# ## Define the program
# This notebook will also show some advanced features of Bloqade, in particular, how to
# use the `slice` and `record` API to build a program that is compatible with the
# hardware constraints that the rabi drive must be 0 at the end of the protocol.
#
# The idea is that first we define the full waveform we would like to apply to the atoms
# then after defining the full waveform you simply call the `slice` method to slice the
# that waveform stopping at a variable time `run_time`. This works fine for detuning but
# for the Rabi drive, we need to make sure that the Rabi drive is 0 at the end of the
# the waveform. To do this, we use the `record` method to record the value of the Rabi
# drive at the end of the waveform. We then use the `linear` method to append a segment
# to the waveform that fixes the value of the Rabi drive to 0 at the end of the
# waveform. Now any value of `run_time` will be a valid waveform that is compatible
# with the hardware constraints.

# We will run the experiment on the emulator and hardware, saving the results to disk
