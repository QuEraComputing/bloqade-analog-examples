# # Two Qubit Adiabatic Sweep
# ## Introduction
# In this example, we show how to use Bloqade to program an adiabatic sweep on a pair of
# atoms, with the distance between atoms gradually increasing per task. This will allow
# us to explore the effect of the Rydberg interaction. We will run the program on both
# the emulator and the hardware to compare the results.

# ## Defining the Program
# Now, we define our program of interest. For an adiabatic protocol, we keep that Rabi
# frequency at a considerable value while slowly ramping the detuning from a large
# negative to a positive value. The idea is that when the detuning is large and
# negative the atoms remain in the ground state. As the detuning is ramped to positive
# values, the atoms are able to be excited to the Rydberg state, however if the atoms
# are too close together, the Rydberg interactions effectively acts like a negative
# detuning to neighboring atoms, preventing them from being excited. This is the
# blockade effect. For atoms that are sufficiently far apart, the Rydberg interaction
# is negligible and the atoms can be excited to the Rydberg state. As the atoms get
# closer together, the Rydberg interaction becomes more significant the probability of
# exciting both atoms becomes smaller. The typical length scale for the cross over from
# the non-interacting to the blockade regime is the blockade radius.
#
# Note that you can perform arithmetic operations directly on variables in the program
# but this requires the variable to be explicitly declared by passing a string to the
# `var` function and THEN doing arithmetic on it.

# ## Run on Emulator and Hardware
# In previous examples, we have shown how to run a program on the emulator and hardware.
# First, we will run the program on the emulator and save the results to a file.

# We can then save the results to a file.

# <p class="admonition-title">Hardware Execution Cost</p>

# ## Plot the Results
# To show the blockade effect on the system, we will plot the
# probability of having `0`, `1`, or `2` Rydberg atoms as a function of time.
# We will do this for both the emulator and the hardware. We can use the
# following function to get the probabilities from the shot counts of each
# of the different configurations of the two Rydberg atoms: `00`, `10`, `01`, and `11`.
# Note that `0` corresponds to the Rydberg state while `1` corresponds to the
# ground state. As such, `00` corresponds to two Rydberg atoms, `10`  and `01`
# corresponds to one Rydberg atom and one ground-state atom, and `11` corresponds
# to two ground-state atoms.

# object.
