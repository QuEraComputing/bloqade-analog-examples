# # Lattice Gauge Theory Simulation
# ## Introduction
# In this notebook, we utilize Aquila to simulate the dynamics of a Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) with a 1D Rydberg atom chain. 
# In the realm of gauge theories, it has been discovered that the Z2 ground state and the quantum scar of the Rydberg chain correspond to the 'string' state and the string-inversion mechanism of the studied LGT, respectively. 
# More intriguingly, by selectively addressing certain atoms, we can induce defects in the chain and simulate the propagation of particle-antiparticle pairs. 
# This notebook is inspired by the paper by F. M. Surace et al. (DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevX.10.021041).

# ## Define the Program

# %%
import os
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from bloqade.analog import save, load, cast, piecewise_linear
from bloqade.analog.ir.location import Chain

    os.mkdir("data")

# %% [markdown]
# We introduce two new features of Bloqade here in order to accomplish this LGT simulation.
#
# Firstly, instead of building the waveforms off the program itself using methods like `.piecewise_linear` and `.piecewise_constant` as seen in previous tutorials, 
# we build the waveforms outside the program and then use the `.apply` method to put them into the program. 
# This is similar to the *Multi-qubit Blockaded Rabi Oscillations* tutorial except instead of building an entire program 
# without a geometry and then applying it on top of one, we introduce waveforms to an existing program structure.
#
# For complex programs such as this one this makes prototyping significantly easier 
# (you can view individual waveforms by calling `.show()` on them so long as there are no variables in the waveform) and keeps things modular.
#
# Secondly, we need to be able to "selectively address" certain atoms. 
# This is accomplished via Local Detuning where we are able to control how much of the global detuning 
# is applied to each atom through a multiplicative scaling factor. 
#
# Bloqade has two methods of doing this (refer to the "Advanced Usage" page) but here we opt for the `.scale` method. 
# We create a list of values from 0 to 1 with length equal to the number of atoms in the system. 
# A value of 1 means the atom should experience the full detuning waveform while 0 means the atom should not experience it at all.
# The n-th value in the list corresponds to the n-th atom in the system.

# %%
N_atom = 13
# Setup the detuning scaling per atom.
# Note that the list of scaling values has a length equal to 
# the number of atoms
detuning_ratio = [0] * N_atom
detuning_ratio[1:(N_atom-1):2] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
detuning_ratio[(N_atom-1)//2] = 1
# Notice that the detuning ratio will allow us to prepare a Z2 
# ordered phase. However, the sequence of contiguous 1s in the 
# middle introduce a defect.
